I'm Montes, a web developer with 20 years of experience working remotely for a [catalonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia) company, [Incubalia](https://incubalia.com). I live in Barcelona and I combine remote work for Incubalia with my Motorhomes focused web [acuestas.es](https://acuestas.es).

Here you will find information about my work on web development combined with my other passion, travel the world.

You can find more information about me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/montesjmm) and [Github](https://github.com/montes).
