The car boot sale is held in Edinburgh's Ocean Terminal Car Park (Westside) on the F floor and I have to say it was one of our favorite shopping activities in the month we spent in Edinburgh.

Held on Sundays from 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., you can see more information about the schedules on [their facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/oceanterminalcarbootsale/).

First go to the Edinburgh Ocean terminal.

You have to take the elevator to the F floor.
