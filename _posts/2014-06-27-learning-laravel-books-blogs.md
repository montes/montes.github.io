With this post I want to start a series of posts about [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), the PHP framework that I’ve already used in two projects and I’ve been very pleasantly surprised with. If you are curious one of them is a personal project (sorry only in spanish): [Acuestas](https://acuestas.es/).

Laravel has quickly become one of the greatest PHP frameworks, or at least one of the most famous according to [google trends](http://google.com/trends).

The main advantage of Laravel over other frameworks (that I personally can confirm) is over all the **productivity**, is amazing how easily you obtain results with Laravel, is a matter of minutes to setup everything and start writing your model, and after this it even becomes better, when you already have written the model, writing the controllers/views is faster than anything I had seen in PHP.

## Books about Laravel 4

Thanks to its reputation, there are already many books with Laravel 4 as it’s main theme, most of theme self-published through [leanpub.com](http://leanpub.com/) by Laravel’s community members.

### Beginners

* [Laravel: Code Bright](https://leanpub.com/codebright)
* [Getting Stuff Done with Laravel 4](https://leanpub.com/gettingstuffdonelaravel)
* [Laravel in Action](http://www.manning.com/surguy/) (Canceled because of low demand)

### Intermediate/Advanced

* [Implementing Laravel](https://leanpub.com/implementinglaravel)
* [Laravel 4 Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/laravel4cookbook) (with Taylor Otwell, Laravel’s creator)
* [Laravel Testing Decoded](https://leanpub.com/laravel-testing-decoded)
* [Laravel: From Apprentice To Artisan](https://leanpub.com/laravel) (written by Taylor Otwell)
* [Build APIs You Won’t Hate](https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate)

There are also some [PacktPub’s Laravel books](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Laravel&tag=mooontes-21), but I can’t recommend Packtpub’s books.

## Blogs, newsletter, videos…

Besides books there are more sources of Laravel’s wisdom, one of my favourites is [Laracasts](http://laracasts.com/), created by [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) where he uploads Laravel’s videos almost daily. It's not free, but just 9$/month.
