Although there are **many vegetarian restaurants in Barcelona** and many of them are not bad at all, after all these years in the end **we have stayed with two favorites** that for us are the **best vegetarian restaurants in Barcelona** and they are the ones I will tell you about. Both are restaurants with **fair prices** and whose clientele is mainly local and are located in the center of Barcelona.

## 1. L'Hortet Restaurant

L'Hortet is **our number one**, it is a vegetarian restaurant with **50 years of history** that was started by Professor Nicolas Capo, already at that time a promoter of vegetarian food and then was continued by his daughter in 1990 and today it is the granddaughters who continue with the business.

The best thing about the restaurant is **the atmosphere**, the vast majority of the clientele are **neighbors who come here regularly**, young people but also many older people who come many times taking advantage of the discount offers if you pay several menus in advance. It is not uncommon to find several people at the door waiting for their turn when the place is full, but you will find that the waitresses are very friendly and know many of their customers by name.

You will have several types of menus to choose from, one or two courses and with or without dessert, and you can choose between **different options** for the first course, second course and dessert. Although it is a vegetarian restaurant, you **will always find vegan options** as well. Before the pandemic there was a free salad buffet option for the first course, but they haven't put it back yet.

Although I am no specialist, I would say that **the food is really good**, homemade and with good products. For example Sonia who is one of the owners and also a waitress is in charge of making many of the desserts so you can always discuss any aspect of the desserts with her.

## 2. Biocenter Restaurant

Coincidentally the Biocenter is across the street from the Hortet and **also has a history of many years**, more than 30 years. And the coincidences do not end there, the daughters of the long time owner are also now in charge of the restaurant.

The Biocenter is a **slightly larger** restaurant but with a similar ambience, also mostly local customers in a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere. Here we keep the salad buffet as an option and very similar menu options.

The food is also very good, unpretentious and with special emphasis on the desserts that you can see on display at the entrance.
