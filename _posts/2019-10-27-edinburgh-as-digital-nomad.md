*Post in construction!*

This is my second trip to Edinburgh, I was there for two weeks for the first time in 2016 and now we'll be there for one month. Both times using AirBnB for accommodation (we hired a room, not an entire flat! Edinburgh center is not cheap!).

I'll use this post for my previous planning and I'll be updating it while we are there in 2019 November.
