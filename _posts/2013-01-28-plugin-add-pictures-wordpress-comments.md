About a month ago I added my first public plugin to “Worpress’ Plugin Directory”, this is a plugin that allows users to attach pictures to his comments, also multimedia files like PDFs!

| ![Add pictures to comments]({{ "/assets/images/plugin-add-pictures-wordpress-comments-1.png" | absolute_url }}) | ![Add pictures to comments]({{ "/assets/images/plugin-add-pictures-wordpress-comments-2.png" | absolute_url }}) |

And you can see the pictures from the WordPress’ admin:

![Add pictures to comments]({{ "/assets/images/plugin-add-pictures-wordpress-comments-3.png" | absolute_url }})

The plugin is tested with last WordPress’ themes “Twenty Eleven” and “Twenty Twelve”.
