Right now I'm in Barcelona and I want to go to Canada, but I want to stay in some countries in the middle and I want to do it with **cheap flights** (max around $200) and also staying in cities with **low airbnb** rates (no London $200/day airbnbs please!). Oh and I only want **direct flights**!

The biggest problem will be the Atlantic crossing so I will begin with this flight, **which is the cheapest flight from Europe to North/Center America?**
