I want to visit canada but I'm not sure which country to fly from, so I've been looking at which **countries are the cheapest to fly to Canada from**.

The first thing I discovered is that there must not be many people who have a similar need because in Skyscanner **you can't do a search by putting only the destination**, so you have to do it the other way around, put that you want to leave Canada without putting the destination, you can do that and at the end the list will be very similar.

Using that list as a seed and doing my own searches, these are the results with the top of the cheapest countries to fly from to Canada, some sample flights:
