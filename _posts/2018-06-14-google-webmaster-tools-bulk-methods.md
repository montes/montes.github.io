## Working with Google Webmaster Tools and many data

Last week I was in need for a fast method to add a couple hundred urls to Webmaster Tools removal section and I found [this Lih Chen's](https://github.com/noitcudni/google-webmaster-tools-bulk-url-removal) chrome extension that does exactly that, it adds a form to the page that allows you to upload a file with one URL on each line and you can leave it alone doing the hard work.

I was very happy being able to found this solution, so when this week I read [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mjcachon/status/1006671453830475777) from [@mjcachon](https://twitter.com/mjcachon/) asking for help to bulk upload parameters to Webmaster Tools, I saw an opportunity to give back my luck and have some fun. That's how my new chrome extension to bulk add parameters was born, you can find it on my github: [https://github.com/montes/google-webmaster-tools-bulk-add-parameters](https://github.com/montes/google-webmaster-tools-bulk-add-parameters)
