I've been long time searching for a card or USB TDT HD compatible with all three main Operating Systems I use and in the end I found it, is the WinTV NOVA-T-HD:

![Google Trends Laravel]({{ "/assets/images/usb-tdt-dvb-t-hd-ubuntu-osx-windows-1.jpg" | absolute_url }})

It works perfect both on Ubuntu 10.10 and OS X 10.6.5 just plugging in, you don't need to setup anything. I didn't test it on Windows but drivers for it are included.

Within Ubuntu I use it with "Me TV" (_sudo aptitude install me-tv_).

![Google Trends Laravel]({{ "/assets/images/usb-tdt-dvb-t-hd-ubuntu-osx-windows-2.png" | absolute_url }})

On OS X you only must to install Eye TV and it will work like a charm (this is the hardware that is into famous Mac compatible dongles "elgato").

I bought it on a MediaMarkt for under 50â‚¬.
