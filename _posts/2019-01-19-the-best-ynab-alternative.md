There was one week left from my *You Need a Budget* trial, I was very happy with the tool and convinced of paying that "$6.99/month" when I realized that there was a tiny asterisk pointing to this phrase "*Billed annually at $83.99*", I wasn't expecting this ðŸ¤¬ old school marketing from them. I felt duped and instantly started the search of an alternative with a better price and similar functionality.

## 1. YNAB vs Google Spreadsheets
There are tons of free Spreadsheets trying to mimic *You Need a Budget*

I discarded all of them because I simply don't like their usability/look, they don't feel *right*.

These are two of the best:

## 2. GemBudget (3$/month - 30$ year)

I didn't like their webpage, the app seems **very poor** and if you look at their screenshots it doesn't look very similar to YNAB.

## 3. EveryDollar (free - $99/year)

This is one of the best YNAB alternatives and has a free version where you can't have accounts, I need accounts so I would need the "plus" version, but the "plus" version costs $8.25/month billed yearly at $99 so is the same thing as YNAB... NO THX!

## 4. intuit mint (free)

I didn't like it at all, too many tabs, **too many things** that overwhelmed me.

## 5. CountAbout ($9.99/year - $39.99/year)

Similar functionality than YNAB and good price, but in my honest opinion the **usability is horrible**, for example you must click each category to see its contents and it looks like an old Windows app from 10 or 15 years ago.

## 7. The best YNAB alternative! financier.io (free - 12$/year)

This is my opinion of course, but if what you are searching for is **something similar to YNAB** but with a **better price**, and you don't need the mobile app or automatic accounts, this is **the best**!

And if this wasn't enough, there is a free version! the paid version has syncing (the free one lives in your browser).
