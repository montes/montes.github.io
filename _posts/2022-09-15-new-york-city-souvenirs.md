I think that when we talk about New York souvenirs there are two main groups, **first**, typical sovenirs like an *I Love New York hoodie* and **second** several products that weren't born to be souvenirs but as you can only get them in New York or are made in New York can be even better souvenirs than the first ones.

## 1. Typical NYC Souvenirs ##

There are two main locations in Manhattan for all that typical souvenirs we all know (snowballs, magnets, cups, keyrings...).

### 1.1. What to expect? ###

There are tons of NYC souvenirs, these are the most popular ones:

* Magnets

### 1.2. Times Square sorroundings ###

As you can imagine there are a ton of souvenir stores in this area, but I will tell you my two favorite ones:

* **Grand Slam New York**
This one is just in the middle of Times Square, is the largest one and my favorite, tons of souvenirs and many discounts too. I was thinking it would be very expensive but it wasn't, don't miss the outlet in the basement!
![Grand Slam New York](/assets/images/2022-09-15-002-nyc-souvenirs-grand-slam-new-york.jpg "Grand Slam New York"){:loading="lazy"}

* **Memories of New York**
You'll need to walk from Times Square towards the Flatiron bulding to find this one and it'll be worth it. It has tons of souvenirs, reasonable prices and a long time owner that will help you with all your souvenir needs. They possibly have the largest collection of **New York magnets** in the whole city.

### 1.3. Manhattan's Chinatown ###

This is a little more like the jungle, you will find **cheaper prices** but you will need to search through a lot of small stores sometimes with *aggressive* sellers trying to get you to buy something. You will find also some products that are not available in the Times Square stores.

### 1.4. Other souvenir shops ###

* **New York Public Library Shop** This is a very nice store, you will find unique products here that you won't find anywhere else.
