Hi! I'm **Javier Montes**, I'm 42 years old and I've dedicated all my life to programming (oh! and I love christmas 🎅 😍)

![Javier Montes](/assets/images/javier-montes.jpg "Javier Montes")

I started when I was 12 with an **Amstrad CPC 6128** like this, typing code of games written in basic from the user manual:

![Amstrad CPC 6128](/assets/images/amstrad-cpc-6128.jpg "Amstrad CPC 6128")

I also was the sysop of a [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) in the nineties, Gijon BBS, this was the intro that was included as a tiny executable file with all downloaded files from my BBS 🤩

I started in the instant messaging world with **ICQ**! and I made a lot of webpages just for fun and some trying to earn some money that were a dead end. I've been working as a programmer **more than 20 years**, the last **8 of them** as a **remote** programmer, I work most days from my home in **Barcelona's center**, also some days from coffee shops, from **my camper van** or another city I maybe visiting.

Like a year ago two events came to my life, **I found [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio)** on twitter and I changed all my **workday hours to the morning** having the evening free for side projects. This two things made my **Digital Maker Soul** went back and it went back stronger than ever, **not so young makers also can do it!**

So now that 2019 is starting I want to begin a challenge that has been in my mind for some time, as this other digital makers, I want to make products online and I want to share the details on my blog.

## Which is exactly the goal?

Start making money that come independently from if I'm working or not (passive?) and it must come from the things I do on internet. Just that.

## Secondary goals
* Learn to skate with my new longboard (I'm on that already!)
* Do more in general, more posts, more tweets, more learning, new things... I started a [podcast](/category/podcast_emprendiendo) on December! (spanish language)
* Learn SEO
* Write more in english (my mother language is spanish)
* Become a [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) expert
* Improve my existing site: [acuestas.es](https://acuestas.es)
* Start new projects (I have some ideas that already registered domains for and I want to launch it all on 2019)
* Make a desktop app with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
